# character-counter
A simple web application that counts characters in real time as you type.

### Working

When you open the webpage and start typing in the textarea, the real-time character counter updates dynamically to provide you with information about your input:

- **Total Character Count**: This count indicates the current total number of characters you've typed into the textarea.

- **Remaining Character Count**: This count shows the number of characters you can still input before reaching the maximum limit.
